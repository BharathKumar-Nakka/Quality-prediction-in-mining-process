# ML_FINAL_PROJECT Quality-prediction-in-mining-process

Hi there .. This is Bharath Kumar Nakka. This is short intro about our project Quality prediction in mining process.

In this paper, we are proposing principal component regression models, which means combining the principal components with regression models. The main objectives of the project are building multiple machine-learning regression models to predict the percentage of Silica Feed in Iron ore. Generating Principal Components, combining PCA and Regression models, and evaluating the models using various regression metrics, such as r2 value, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and MAPE.

Assessing and predicting iron quality, in general, requires analyzing the complex relationship between variables, which demands domain expertise as well as chemical analysis. This process is time-consuming. However, machine learning algorithms can analyze the complex relationships and nonlinearity in the data with ease. Moreover, machine learning models are adaptable to changes in the model parameters, and they exhibit high scalability, allowing them to operate on large datasets. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, mining processing can be optimized in terms of manpower and operational costs.
